mhl_to_csv v0.5 README


INFO
------------------------------
This program takes 1 or more MHL files (from software such as Silverstack or YoYotta)
and generates a single CSV file of the hashes contained within the MHLs.

The aim of this is to be able to then easily compare a set of MHLs from a shoot day
against an MHL from the archive to ensure checksum hashes match.
------------------------------



USAGE
------------------------------
To use, first install as a pip package:


Once installed, you can now use like so:
1. In command line, type mhl-to-csv
2. Add a space after the above.
3. Drag and drop the MHL files you wish to convert to a single CSV into the terminal window.
4. Hit Enter. The program should run and tell you where the files were saved.
